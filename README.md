Compilation of papers covering both inpainting and outpainting in medical imaging


| Title | Authors | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| [Body composition assessment with limited field-of-view computed tomography: A semantic image extension perspective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841523001123?via%3Dihub) | Kaiwen Xu, Thomas Li, Mirza S. Khan, Riqiang Gao, Sanja L. Antic, Yuankai Huo, Kim L. Sandler, Fabien Maldonado, Bennett A. Landman | Proposes a method in which a scan is artificially truncated so that the ground truth is known for training in order to expand the FOV of low dose CT scans |
|[Diffusion-based Generative Image Outpainting for Recovery of FOV-Truncated CT Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04769) | Michelle Espranita Liman, Daniel Rueckert, Florian J. Fintelmann, Philip MÃ¼ller | Proposes a diffusion model which expands the FOV on truncated CT scans |
